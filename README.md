# AVS-36 ‚Äî The First Misstep Reborn

Recovered from corrupted schematics buried in a shattered orbital relay, the **AVS-36** is one of Old Earth‚Äôs earliest attempts at giving infantry controllable automatic fire ‚Äî an ambitious but flawed weapon born before its time.

Designed by Soviet engineer Sergei Simonov in the 1930s, the AVS-36 was a select-fire rifle chambered in the punishing 7.62√ó54mmR cartridge. It was meant to bridge the gap between bolt-action precision and machine gun volume. But the world ‚Äî and its metallurgy ‚Äî wasn‚Äôt ready. Fragile internals, harsh recoil, and frequent jamming sent the rifle into obscurity before war could truly test it.

Centuries after Earth‚Äôs fall, fragments of its design resurfaced on the Rim ‚Äî raw, unstable, and barely functional. But a desperate weaponsmith saw potential. The AVS-36 now walks again, rebuilt from memory rot and scrap. Not perfect. Not forgiving. But real.

An early experiment reborn. A reminder that even failure has teeth.
