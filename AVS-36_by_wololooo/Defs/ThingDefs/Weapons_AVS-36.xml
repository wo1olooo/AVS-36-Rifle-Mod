    <description>The AVS-36 is a rare and unstable artifact from the opening years of Old Earth’s Second World War — a weapon forged in haste, not mastery. It represents the Soviet Union’s earliest leap toward automatic infantry arms, years before the world was ready to follow.

Developed by engineer Sergei Simonov, the AVS-36 (Avtomaticheskaya Vintovka Simonova) was one of the first select-fire rifles adopted by a major power. Chambered in the punishing 7.62×54mmR cartridge, it was meant to give infantry the flexibility of automatic fire in a package smaller than a machine gun. But the idea outpaced the era’s engineering.

Its recoil was fierce. Its internals wore fast. Accuracy plummeted in full-auto. Frontline troops were often told to avoid using its automatic mode altogether. It was a weapon of innovation — but also of compromise.

As war intensified, the AVS-36 was quickly replaced by sturdier rifles. Production halted. Its name faded into the machinery of history.

Centuries later, long after Earth was silenced by fire and decay, a fragment of AVS-36 schematics was recovered from the black box of a sunken orbital wreck. Corrupted, barely readable, and etched in obsolete code, it was restored by a determined weaponsmith who saw not failure, but potential.

Now, across the fractured Rim, the AVS-36 breathes again. Rare, temperamental, and fiercely powerful, it offers ancient firepower in a modern wasteland — a reminder that even flawed weapons can leave deep scars.

An early step into the age of automatics. Imperfect. Ambitious. Alive once more.
