	<description>Recovered from the corrupted memory of a derelict pre-Fall vessel, the AVS-36 is one of Old Earth’s first automatic infantry rifles. Designed in the 1930s by Soviet engineer Sergei Simonov, it was chambered in the punishing 7.62×54mmR and featured early select-fire capability — bold, but unreliable.

Heavy recoil, fragile internals, and constant jamming doomed it to obscurity. Few were made. Fewer survived.

Centuries later, its blueprints were salvaged and rebuilt on the Rim. Flawed, powerful, and unmistakably human — the AVS-36 walks again.
